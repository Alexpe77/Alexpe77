#  Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I recently got my degree in web development @**BeCode** Belgium.</br>

Much of our training at BeCode consists on hands-on projects and we've worked both in group and alone. </br>
You will therefore see on my profile both repos devoted to practical exercises and concrete projects. </br>
Below you can see the technologies that I have already learned so far.</br>
