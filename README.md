#  Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I got my degree in web development @**BeCode** Belgium early 2024.</br>
Right after that I worked as a software developer for an industry.</br>
Now I focus myself on personnal projects.</br>

Much of our training at BeCode consists on hands-on projects and we've worked both in group and alone. </br>
You will therefore see on my profile both repos devoted to practical exercises and concrete projects. </br>
Below you can see the technologies that I have already learned so far.</br>
