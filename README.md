#  Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I recently got my degree in web development @**BeCode** Belgium.</br>
You can see that there's "no commit" for a 3 months period, it's beacause i was in internship, but don't worry i worked a lot 😄 ! </br>
Much of our training consists on hands-on projects and we've worked both in group and alone. </br>
You will therefore see on my profile both repos devoted to practical exercises and concrete projects. </br>
Below you can see the technologies that I have already learned so far.</br>
I'm currently improving my skills in **Symfony** 🚀 </br>
